History confirms that the preservation of elements of festive imagery is not an easy task. We are often aware of the disappearance of festive elements due to their deterioration, due to an accident, or simply due to a prolonged lack of interest on the part of groups and/or institutions.

Faced with the threat of loss of figures due to abandonment or simple accident, the object of this project aims to facilitate the application of new techniques based on 3D technology that contribute to the conservation and recovery of material heritage. Obtaining 3D images opens the door for these to be used in the construction process of partial or complete replicas.
